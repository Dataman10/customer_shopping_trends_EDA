# Shopping Trends EDA

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a shopping trends dataset (~3,900 records) using Python. The analysis focuses on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, product preferences, and payment patterns using descriptive statistics and visualizations.[1][2]

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes age, gender, and location for each customer, along with attributes such as item purchased, category, size, color, season, and purchase amount. It also records review ratings, discounts, promo code usage, previous purchases, payment methods, and purchase frequency to support detailed behavioral analysis.[2]

## Objectives

- Understand who the customers are (demographic and regional profiles).[2]
- Analyze what they buy and when (products, seasons, and order values).[2]
- Identify how they pay and how often they shop (payment methods, frequency, loyalty proxies).[2]

## Analysis Performed

The notebook performs data inspection, summary statistics, and distribution analysis to assess data quality and overall trends. It computes grouped metrics (e.g., mean purchase amount by category, season, and payment method), pivot tables, and visualizations to highlight spending patterns and customer preferences.[1]

## Key Insights (Examples)

- Categories and seasons with higher average purchase amounts and stronger engagement.[2]
- Popular payment methods and their association with purchase frequency.[2]
- Relationships between discounts, promo usage, and review ratings or basket value.[2]

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, with Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations. The workflow is structured to be easily extended for feature engineering and predictive modeling in retail or e‑commerce analytics.[1]
